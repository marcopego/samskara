Samskara is a Ghost theme based on Bootstrap 4. Inspiration was taken from many WordPress themes to create this theme. While there are many Ghost themes found on the internet which follow the grid layout, Samskara provides a traditional blog layout with a sidebar and a main section. The sidebar can be configured with different cards by using JavaScript. **Please send me a link at vasanthdevelopers@gmail.com of your Ghost blog if you are using my theme. That brings smile to me!**
